## 👋 Welcome, Future Full-Stack Developers!

We’re so excited to have you on this incredible journey! Learning to code is challenging, but it’s also one of the most rewarding paths you can take. 🌟

This bootcamp will guide you through the tools, technologies, and mindsets needed to build **real-world applications** and become a **full-stack developer**. By the end, you’ll have the skills to develop projects that amaze and inspire others!

## 🔑 Your Success Starts Here

Here’s some important advice to help you make the most of this experience:

### 🙋‍♂️ Ask Questions Early and Often

We’re here to help you succeed! If you’re stuck or unsure about anything, **reach out** to your Educators and TAs.

-   **No question is too small.** Coding is full of trial and error, and that’s okay!
-   Use our Slack channels to connect with peers and instructors.

### 🤝 Collaboration is Key

You’ll work with your peers to tackle challenges, debug issues, and build projects. Collaboration is a **superpower** in software development, so practice working together effectively!

### 🛠️ Use Your Resources

-   Explore our learning platform, **Synapse**, and follow the instructions provided carefully.
-   Make sure to add **our GitHub as a collaborator** when submitting your projects (your project instructions on Synapse will state *when* to do so). This ensures we can review your code.
